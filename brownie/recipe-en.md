1. 1 1/4 Cup (284 Grams) Melted Butter
1. 2 Cups (401 Grams) Granulated Sugar
1. 1/2 Cup (110 Grams) Dark Brown Sugar
1. 2 Tsp Vanilla Extract
1. 2 Tsp Salt (Preferably Kosher)
1. 6 Eggs
1. 1 Cup (136 Grams) All-Purpose Flour
1. Butter (For Greasing)

### To Top It Off (Optional)

1. Sea Salt
1. Anything you want!

### Required Equipment

1. Bowls
1. A jug
1. Spatula
1. Hand mixer
1. Tin (9x13 Inches)
1. Parchment paper

## How to prepare

1. First, prepare your tin with parchment paper and butter, for later.
1. Next, get one of your bowls or a jug, and put the chocolate in it along with the espresso and cocoa powder, adding a 1/4 at a time.
1. Add in the hot butter and stir, try and make sure it’s hot to help combine everything.
1. Let that sit for two minutes and then stir!
1. In a new bowl, put your sugars in with the vanilla and salt.
1. In yet another bowl, crack your 6 eggs, do a quick shell check and whip the eggs and then add them (slowly as you want, one by one).
1. Whip them together with a hand mixer for as long as it takes for them to go fluffy.
1. Next, add the chocolate mixture and continue whipping.
1. Add the flour, cocoa powder and fold it gently.
   \*Side Note: Don’t fold it too much or it will deflate and be dense.
1. All your ingredients should now be incorporated. Now add the batter into your prepped tin and level it out.
1. Bake for 20 minutes at 350°F or 180°C, they will rise which is normal. Take them out and slam them on the counter, to make them slightly cracked and more even. Add your sea salt on the top, if you wish and bake again for 25 minutes at the same temperature.
   \*Side note: from ages after I wrote this: I have received a couple replies on the baking time (Some have burnt) the additional 25 minutes is not always necessary, I advise anyone following Tasty’s recipe to bake them to their liking.
1. Finally cut them up in 12 or 15 slices and enjoy!
