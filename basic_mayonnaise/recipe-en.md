# Basic Mayonnaise

- **Difficulty:** _Easy_

- **Yield:** _1 1/3 cups_

- **Time:** _5 minutes_

## Ingredients

1. 2 large egg yolks
1. 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1. 4 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1. 1 cup vegetable oil
1. Coarse salt and ground pepper

## How to prepare

1. Place egg yolks in a food processor. (To avoid using raw eggs, substitute yolks from pasteurized eggs.)
1. Add mustard and lemon juice. Pulse ingredients until well combined.
1. With motor running, add oil in a slow, steady stream (mixture should become thick and emulsified). Season with salt and pepper.
1. Refrigerate in an airtight container, up to 1 week.

**Tip #1:** If the mayonnaise separates after the oil is added, the mixture has broken. To bring it to a creamy state, add an egg yolk and 1 teaspoon tepid water to a clean bowl, and slowly add the broken mayonnaise while whisking constantly. Then, whisk in 1/4 cup more oil.
