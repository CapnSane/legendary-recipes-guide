1. Caesar Dressing
1. Croutons

### For the Caesar Dressing

1. 1/2 cup of homemade Mayonnaise
1. Lemon zest (1 Lemon)
1. Lemon Juice (1/2 Lemon Juice)
1. 2 Anchovies in oil
1. 2 Tablespoon of Parmesan Cheese
1. 1 Small Garlic Clove
1. 1 Tablespoon of Dijon Mustard
1. 1 Tablespoon of Olive Oil
1. Black Pepper just to taste
1. Salt just to taste

### For the Croutons

1. 6 Loaves of bread
1. 1 Tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil
1. Oregano
1. Salt

## Modo de Preparo

### Croutons

1. Slice the bread into small cubes. Place them on a baking sheet.
1. Drizzle the cubes with extra virgin olive oil (do not overdo it, as they may not be crispy), sprinkle with oregano to taste and a pinch of salt. Mix well with your hands to incorporate all the ingredients into the cubes. Be careful not to crush them!
1. Place in a preheated oven at 230 ËšC for 5 minutes, remove from the oven and give the pan a shake so that the cubes turn and return to the oven for another 5 minutes or until they are lightly golden.

### Caesar Dressing

Mix all the sauce ingredients well, add a pinch of salt to enhance the flavor and set it aside.

**Tip #1:** It's so simple, throw the ingredients together and mix them. You can use a food processor or blender.
**Tip #2:** The Anchovies already have salt, then you must take care when you put the salt. It's possible that your Caesar Dressing is still salted enough.
**Tip #3:** It's possible using Worcestershire Sauce to increase the dressing flavour, but use a little bit only, a dash Worcestershire sauce is enough.

#### Para servir

Place some leaves and croutons on a salad platter, drizzle with the Caesar dressing. Repeat this procedure for three or more layers. Grate Parmesan cheese to finish and add more sauce to taste.

## Storing the salad dressing

This will keep up to 3 days if you make a homemade mayonnaise with raw yolk. The egg yolk in this dressing it needs to be refrigerated immediately if not using right away.
